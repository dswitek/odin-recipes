    <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>

    <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti.</strong> Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.</li>
    <li><strong>auté the garlic.</strong>S  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat.
